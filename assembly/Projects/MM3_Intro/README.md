## History

During my college years I had an "Interface Languages" class where I learned about assembly code. We eventually had to do a bit of a final project using assembly code to do either a game, an animation or anything of that nature.

I had watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax0_0b-GaVM) of a laser cutter playing the intro theme as it carves out a Mega Man on a metal sheet a while back and thus I had the idea of recreating it for my school project.

This project took me about a weekend or so to create mainly thanks to the fact that we already had some macros libs from previous projects and assignments.
